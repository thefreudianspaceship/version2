# Towards a New Earth: Practice and Experimentation

How can we develop new modes of thinking and being that break free from colonial and capitalist subjectivities?

## Introduction

This essay explores practical and experimental approaches to creating what Frantz Fanon called "a new earth" - ways of living, thinking, and relating that exceed the limitations imposed by colonial and capitalist orders.

## The Problem of Inherited Subjectivity

We inherit modes of subjectivity shaped by centuries of colonial violence and capitalist exploitation. These aren't just external impositions - they structure our desires, our relationships, and our very sense of what's possible.

## Practice as Transformation

Transformation requires more than theoretical understanding. It demands sustained practice - experimental engagement with new ways of organizing life, thought, and community.

## Experiments in Living

What might such experiments look like? Drawing on examples from autonomous communities, mutual aid networks, and collective forms of care, we can identify emerging practices that point toward alternative worlds.

## The Role of Failure

Experimentation necessarily involves failure. But failure isn't simply negative - it reveals the constraints we're working against and opens new directions for practice.

## Conclusion

Building a new earth isn't about implementing a blueprint. It's an ongoing process of experimentation, learning, and transformation that must be undertaken collectively.
